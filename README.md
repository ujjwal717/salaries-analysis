# salaries-analysis
This data analytics project named "salary analysis" basically analyses the salaries of different job titles such as "ML Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Data Engineer", "Data Analyst" and more according to various factors.

I have used data from kaggle.

I have used panndas to manipulate and analyse data and used plotly to visualize the data and python for programming.
