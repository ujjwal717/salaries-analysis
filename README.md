# salaries-analysis
This data analytics project named "salary analysis" basically analyses the salaries of different job titles such as "ML Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Data Engineer", "Data Analyst" and more according to various factors.

I have used data from kaggle.

I have used panndas to manipulate and analyse data and used plotly to visualize the data and python for programming.

Different analysis given below :- 


1) **Average Salary in different titles across different Experience level**

**Explanation** :- It uses multiple charts that are divided according to multiple experience level and each visual has different job 
  titles.So, basically there are 3 visuals for 3 different experience level - "Entry", "Mid" , "Senior" and all these experience level 
  contains different job titles in the X-axis and salary in the Y-axis


  **Insight 1 :-** I found that in general scenarios, entry level roles are paid least as compared to mid level or senior level.

  **Reason 1 :-** The reason for entry level getting less salary is the fact that when an employee joins as a entry level data analyst or any 
  other title for that matter, it takes time and requires supervision from his/her senior that may be mid level or senior level and in 
  beginning they are not given really crucial tasks due to which they are paid less initially. 


  **Insight 2 :-** "Machine Learning Engineer" earns more than other mentioned or considered titles such as "data analyst","data engineer" and 
  more in all the different experience levels.

  **Reason 2 :-** The ratio between job available and skilled machine learning engineer is not that great, so when there is high demand and 
  low supply of good machine learning engineer as compared to other job titles, "Machine Learning Engineer" tends to earn more than other job 
  titles.



2) **The average salary in different countries**

  **Explanation :-** It again contains multiple visuals according to the experience level. After that, the legend has different country names 
  and the bars of the visuals are coded according to those legend colors so that it is easier for the viewer to understand which country is 
  bascially represented in the visual. Note that the Y-axis displays the sum of average salaries and each and every visual supports hover tool 
  so the visuals will show details about specific part on placing cursor on required part of visuals.


  **Insight :-** I have found that in maximum scenarios(combination of job titles and experience level), United States pays maximum to the 
  employees followed by Canada and United Kingdom. I have also noticed that France pays relatively lower than other countries.

  **Reason :-** The most glaring reason that might have lead to the conclusion that United States pays more than other countries is the fact 
  that it is very easy for citizens or companies to start a startup. The government is very open for such things and loans are often provided 
  without much hassle for startups. Now I am not saying that other countries are not open to startups as other countries are also paying 
  really well, but the ease that US has in that aspect seems a bit better. Also, these startup generally hires employees remotely which leads 
  to more pay as the company/startup doesn't need to setup offices and ultimately pay there employees a bit more.



3) **The Average Salary range from 2021-2023 in different Job Titles**


![avg salary from 2021-2023](https://github.com/ujjwal717/salaries-analysis/assets/93403224/77271347-0e36-4291-ae3d-bb3e89eb5b40)



**Explanation :-** These visuals include a line chart and there are different visuals according to the Job title. Also, X-axis has the year from 2021-2023 and Y-axis has the average salary. 
  The line chart basically shows the trend of average salary of various job titles according to the years that are from 2021-2023.


  **Insight :-** We are considering various job titles such as "Data Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer" and "Data Analyst". Each and every role sees growth in terms of 
  salary over the years. But we also see a little decrease in the machine learning(which is present because of data that will be explained in reason below). Other than that every job title 
  has grown and machine learning also increases substantially in the next year. Also, note that, I have not considered experience level as a criteria in this analysis because I wanted to do 
  this particular analysis over the fact that "how much that specific job title has increased or grown in those given years irrespective of the experience level as it is really obvious that 
  entry level has less salary than mid level and mid level has less salary than senior level roles normally.


  **Reason :-** The reason for little dip in the machine learning engineer might be from the fact that the year of dip(2022) might have more entry level roles in the dataset due to which the 
  average of that year as a whole depleted a bit in the machine learning engineer title which might not be the fact in the other job titles. Other than that, the increase or growth of these 
  roles is really great as with the growth of AI/ML, the data related roles such as data analyst, data engineering etc have also flourished as the creating ETL pipelines for the data and the 
  effective analysis for the data is also required and that requirement is increasing because AI/ML are more related to data and modelling in ML can only be done effectively if the data is 
  cleaned and usable which gave this boost to data related roles as well.
