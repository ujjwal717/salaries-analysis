# salaries-analysis
This data analytics project named "salary analysis" basically analyses the salaries of different job titles such as "ML Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Data Engineer", "Data Analyst" and more according to various factors.

I have used data from kaggle.

I have used panndas to manipulate and analyse data and used plotly to visualize the data and python for programming.

Different analysis given below :- 


1) **Average Salary in different titles across different Experience level**

**Explanation** :- It uses multiple charts that are divided according to multiple experience level and each visual has different job 
  titles.So, basically there are 3 visuals for 3 different experience level - "Entry", "Mid" , "Senior" and all these experience level 
  contains different job titles in the X-axis and salary in the Y-axis


  **Insight 1 :-** I found that in general scenarios, entry level roles are paid least as compared to mid level or senior level.

  **Reason 1 :-** The reason for entry level getting less salary is the fact that when an employee joins as a entry level data analyst or any 
  other title for that matter, it takes time and requires supervision from his/her senior that may be mid level or senior level and in 
  beginning they are not given really crucial tasks due to which they are paid less initially. 


  **Insight 2 :-** "Machine Learning Engineer" earns more than other mentioned or considered titles such as "data analyst","data engineer" and 
  more in all the different experience levels.

  **Reason 2 :-** The ratio between job available and skilled machine learning engineer is not that great, so when there is high demand and 
  low supply of good machine learning engineer as compared to other job titles, "Machine Learning Engineer" tends to earn more than other job 
  titles.



2) **The average salary in different countries**

  **Explanation :-** It again contains multiple visuals according to the experience level. After that, the legend has different country names 
  and the bars of the visuals are coded according to those legend colors so that it is easier for the viewer to understand which country is 
  bascially represented in the visual. Note that the Y-axis displays the sum of average salaries and each and every visual supports hover tool 
  so the visuals will show details about specific part on placing cursor on required part of visuals.


  **Insight :-** I have found that in maximum scenarios(combination of job titles and experience level), United States pays maximum to the 
  employees followed by Canada and United Kingdom. I have also noticed that France pays relatively lower than other countries.

  **Reason :-** The most glaring reason that might have lead to the conclusion that United States pays more than other countries is the fact 
  that it is very easy for citizens or companies to start a startup. The government is very open for such things and loans are often provided 
  without much hassle for startups. Now I am not saying that other countries are not open to startups as other countries are also paying 
  really well, but the ease that US has in that aspect seems a bit better. Also, these startup generally hires employees remotely which leads 
  to more pay as the company/startup doesn't need to setup offices and ultimately pay there employees a bit more.
